# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18.07.2018 (my birthday actually =)
**Today's Progress**: Creating the project files. Trying to land what expectations I should have for the final product.

**Thoughts:** I am writing this on day 4 actually, since I didn't really decide to do the 100DaysOfCode until now. I have had the idea for this app for a while, just havent had the energy nor the will to do anything about it, until I downloaded and started reading "Crusing hyper-casual games" by Trey Smith.

### Day 2: 19.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting something on screen. Just a list of hardcoded numbers that change color when beeing pressed.

**Thoughts:**: It's been a while since I coded any java, but it's slowly coming back to me.. Also, the new Android Studio seems better than and more snappy than the one I used a long time ago when it was still in beta.

### Day 3: 20.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting a single stage of the game "ready". Testing out my reference a bit to get some inspiration.

**Thoughts**: When learning coding we used java, and after getting a job I have been mostly in the .NET universe. Revisiting java now, feels like a step back. There are a lot of problems I have had to solve in different (using more code) ways than I would have if I were coding C#.

### Day 4: 21.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting the different states of the game to behave as one would expect. Also, levels are complete and numbers no longer overlap.

**Thoughts**: Things are progressing faster than expected, getting a feeling that this might actually turn into a game at some point. Still missing a lot of things around the game, like score, lvls, balancing difficulty, animations, graphics.. but the game-logic is more or less in place.

### Day 5: 22.07.2018
**Today's progress**: No progress today, just Android Studio trouble.. Did make an attempt to create a positive/negative feedback when completing / failing a stage, animating an image, to no success.

**Thoughts**: StackOverflow to the rescue!

### Day 6: 23.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Made the animation work!!

**Thoughts**: I am sitting here at 11.30 PM, just finished the one hour of work I'm supposed to do today, and thinking that tomorrow is going to be tough... Still doing the log, and the tweet, but I am wondering if there will be days without any coding at all..
