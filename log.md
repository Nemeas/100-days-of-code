# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18.07.2018 (my birthday actually =)
**Today's Progress**: Creating the project files. Trying to land what expectations I should have for the final product.

**Thoughts:** I am writing this on day 4 actually, since I didn't really decide to do the 100DaysOfCode until now. I have had the idea for this app for a while, just havent had the energy nor the will to do anything about it, until I downloaded and started reading "Crusing hyper-casual games" by Trey Smith.

**Link to work:** [Numbers](https://github.com/Nemeas/Numbers)

### Day 2: 19.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting something on screen. Just a list of hardcoded numbers that change color when beeing pressed.

**Thoughts:**: It's been a while since I coded any java, but it's slowly coming back to me.. Also, the new Android Studio seems better than and more snappy than the one I used a long time ago when it was still in beta.

### Day 3: 20.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting a single stage of the game "ready". Testing out my reference a bit to get some inspiration.

**Thoughts**: When learning coding we used java, and after getting a job I have been mostly in the .NET universe. Revisiting java now, feels like a step back. There are a lot of problems I have had to solve in different (using more code) ways than I would have if I were coding C#.

### Day 4: 21.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Getting the different states of the game to behave as one would expect. Also, levels are complete and numbers no longer overlap.

**Thoughts**: Things are progressing faster than expected, getting a feeling that this might actually turn into a game at some point. Still missing a lot of things around the game, like score, lvls, balancing difficulty, animations, graphics.. but the game-logic is more or less in place.

### Day 5: 22.07.2018
**Today's progress**: No progress today, just Android Studio trouble.. Did make an attempt to create a positive/negative feedback when completing / failing a stage, animating an image, to no success.

**Thoughts**: StackOverflow to the rescue!

### Day 6: 23.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Made the animation work!!

**Thoughts**: I am sitting here at 11.30 PM, just finished the one hour of work I'm supposed to do today, and thinking that tomorrow is going to be tough... Still doing the log, and the tweet, but I am wondering if there will be days without any coding at all..

### Day 7: 24.07.2018
**Today's progress**: No progress in the form of a commit =(

**Thoughts**: Trying out the android Ad thingie, looking at the documentation, reading, coding, getting confused, not knowing what I'm doing.. I get this feeling a lot.. Most of what is in the documentation is things I have no clue what means.. Usually I just try googleing the problem before turning to the documentation. This usually pushes me in the right direction. Propably going to do some more googleing tomorrow.. 

### Day 8: 25.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Successfully added ads between each lvl of the game and learned how the whole ads thingie works. 

**Thoughts**: Interesting how easy it is to implement. Also awsome of team google to make so detailed and updated step-by-step guides of how to implement the stuff. Easy and fun to see something that just works right out of the box!

### Day 9: 26.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Makes it possible to complete one lvl, see the ad, and then start playing the next lvl. Also refactoring and structuring a lot of code.

**Thoughts**: I got the exact amount of work I expected done today! And I would like to call the new feature "play-next-lvl". I am thinking that the game should perhaps make use of the Google Play Games to keep track of lvl, highscores etc, at least I believe I can use it for that.. I have no idea how I'm supposed to implement it, nor how it works, so this would be awsome exercise to learn something new.

### Day 10: 27.07.2018
**Today's progress**: No real progress, just playing around with different types of activities/fragments/dialogs to see what works for a "congrats! you did well, tap here to play the next lvl"-message.

**Thoughts**: I don't feel like today was really productive. I got nowhere with the dialog, didn't really feel like this was the correct path, so I guess that I'll try making the message like an Activity next, fullscreen and all, more like my reference; Peak.

### Day 11: 28.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Added a visualisation of the time remaning of the lvl. Also just comitted the next-lvl dialog, even if it don't really work that well, it covers the happyday scenario.

**Thoughts**: I am wondering if I should throw in a new element to the game. Now that the timer is visible, I would like to add a visual cue to random numbers, telling the user that this is a special number (not push this button, allways push this button last/first ?). The cue should indicate that there is some kind of reward attached to the number, like add 6 seconds to the timer, and what action to take. For now the only data I have is the timer and a counter counting completed and failed stages in a lvl... 

I do want this game to be released in some form on Google Play, so I should perhaps just make the game playable before starting to add all kinds of cool and complicating features.. I tend to get too troublesome ideas, setting my standards waaay too high, and never completing a project. If there is one thing I have learned from coding professionally it is three simple letters: MVP! Featuers can be added on later, but making the core functionality is priority 1.

### Day 12: 29.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Added a bit of a delay before each lvl giving the player time to get ready for the next lvl.

**Thoughts**: There are lots of animations needed to get things to look smooth. Haven't really noticed that before in apps, but without them everything feels so off..

### Day 13: 30.07.2018
**Today's progress**: Reading up on Google Play Games.

**Thoughts**: There is a lot to take in.. not really shure what I am reading, or what I want from this service, or what this service can do.. Will continue to do some research.
