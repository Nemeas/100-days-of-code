# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18.07.2018
**Today's Progress**: Creating the project files.

**Thoughts:** I am writing this on day 4 actually, since I didn't really decide to do the 100DaysOfCode until now. I have had the idea for this app for a while, just havent had the energy nor will to do anything about it, until I downloaded and read "Crusing hyper casual".
